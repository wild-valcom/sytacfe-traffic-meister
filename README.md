## Data library

The data are provided by a small service you can find in the `service` folder.

This service can be accessed by a the global variable `trafficMeister` and provide a single method `fetchData`.

```
trafficMeister.fetchData(callBack);
```

The callback is called with the full data list as first parameter.

```
trafficMeister.fetchData(function(err, data) {
  console.log(data);
});
```

The data library can be used as a node module.

```
var trafficMeister = require('traffic-meister');
trafficMeister.fetchData(function(err, data) {
  console.log(data);
});
```
